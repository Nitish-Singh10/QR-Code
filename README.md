#About The Project 
QR ID GENERATOR SYSTEM
Abstract
This project aims to develop a comprehensive QR ID generator system integrated with a visitor management system and vendor data storage, facilitating streamlined registration processes for events. The system will be web-based, allowing real-time QR code generator and guest management. Users will register through the platform, with their details collected and unique QR ID generated dynamically. These QR ID will contain essential user information and be printed for distribution at the event venue. 
Vendor data management will involve the use of QR code scanners to read visitor information, enabling vendors to store relevant data. Real-time monitoring will be facilitated through an event management dashboard, providing insights into check-ins, attendance, and other metrics. The system is designed to handle large volumes of registrations and check-ins concurrently, ensuring scalability and robust performance. Security measures will be implemented to safeguard user information and ensure data integrity. Additionally, communication channels will enable users and administrators to receive notifications and alerts regarding the event and registrations.

# New Updated We have to make on this Project
